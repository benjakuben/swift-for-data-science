# Why Swift for Data Science?

Swift is a better, faster, safer language than Python. Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, but these are available for use from within Swift programs thanks to an interoperability construct. [Read more]() (TODO)

# Swift Language

The easiest, quickest way to start:
- [A Swift Tour](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/site/tutorials/a_swift_tour.ipynb)

Here's a quick language reference (great if you already know how to program):
- [Learn X in Y Minutes (Swift)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/swift/)

Pick one of these:
- [Treehouse]()
- [We ❤️ Swift](https://www.weheartswift.com/)
- [Swift for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=comQ1-x2a1Q) - FreeCodeCamp, YouTube

# SQL
- [Treehouse]()

# Data Science
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) - but check out Google Colaboratory

# Machine Learning
- [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)

# Coming from Python?
